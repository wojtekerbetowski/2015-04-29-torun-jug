`GET /users/123`

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "href": "/users/123"
    },
    {
      "rel": "account",
      "href": "/accounts/987"
    },
    {
      "rel": "address",
      "href": "/addresses/555"
    }
  ]
}
```

---
`GET /addresses/555`

```json
{
  "street": "Sesame",
  "no": 25,
  "zipCode": "12-321",
  "state": "NY",
  "country": "US"
}
```
